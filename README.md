⭐ **Fun Fact:** Even when I’m procrastinating, I somehow end up being productive-like cleaning, cooking, or doing chores instead of the actual work I’m supposed to do. So technically, I’m always kind of getting things done! 😆

💻 **Current Focus:** Deepening my understanding of **AI/ML** and how things work under the hood!
